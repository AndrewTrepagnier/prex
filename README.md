# Prex 🤖

༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ ----- ("Must fix it")

**Prex** is my github bot that lives in my terminal and makes my life easier by guiding me through github conflicts



### Motivation

Navigating divergent or unresolved github commits is perhaps one of the most frustrating issues that I fall victim to during my programming workflows. I never considered myself the savviest at git maintenace, and to be honest, I've come to terms that I don't really need to be. Whenever I am absorbed in my coding project, the last thing I want is my workflow to be interupted by silly github conflict. I finally grew sick of this and built prex.
