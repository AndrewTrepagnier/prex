# Prex 🤖 

༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ ----- ("Must fix it")

**Prex** is my github bot that lives in my terminal and makes my life easier by guiding me through github conflicts



### Motivation

Navigating divergent or unresolved github commits is perhaps one of the most frustrating issues that I fall victim to during my programming workflows. I never considered myself the savviest at git maintenace, and to be honest, I've come to terms that I don't really need to be. Whenever I am absorbed in my coding project, the last thing I want is my workflow to be interupted by silly github conflict. I finally grew sick of this and built prex.

### Future Work
The premises of prex actually stems from a more advanced CLI-style triage bot that I intend to develop in greater detail in the future. His name, Prex, is actually an abbreviation of "Pull Request Execution" since his design objective was to utilize github's webhooks to work alongside me in github itself and the terminal to streamline pull request merging and work scheduling.
